Hi, I'm Juntong "Steven" Shi. I'm a master student at [Stanford Computer Science](https://www.cs.stanford.edu/). Previously, I did undergraduate at [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/)
(USC), studying computer science and applied mathematics.
My research focuses on developing principled and scalable generative models for irregular and heterogeneous data modalities.
I'm also passionate about leveraging these models to tackle socially impactful challenges in science.
