I'm Juntong "Steven" Shi, a undergraduate senior at [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/) (USC) studying computer science and applied mathematics. My research interests focuses on machine learning, with an emphasis on developing **generative models** that can handle heterogenous data structures for various real-world problems.
